# malachyfernandez.github.io 🌐

Welcome to my personal **GitHub Pages** site — a centralized website that showcases my various projects, all hosted directly from this repository.

## 🧠 What is this?

This is a **GitHub Pages** user site. GitHub Pages is a free static site hosting service that lets you turn your GitHub repositories into simple websites. By using the special `malachyfernandez.github.io` repository, I'm able to host a personal site at:

🔗 [malachyfernandez.github.io](https://malachyfernandez.github.io)

## 🗂️ How it's organized

Every project is **self-contained in its own folder**, and each folder is a **copy of a full project repository** that also lives separately on my GitHub profile. This setup makes it easy to:

- Browse each project independently
- View working demos directly in the browser
- Keep the original GitHub repositories clean and version-controlled

Example structure:

```
📁 root/
├── 📁 project-one/
├── 📁 project-two/
├── 📁 project-three/
└── index.html
```

Each project has its own `index.html` file and can be accessed at a URL like:

```
https://malachyfernandez.github.io/project-name/
```

## 💻 What's here?

This site features:

- Fully functional demos of my projects
- Quick links to the original GitHub repositories
- A centralized way to explore what I’ve built

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (varies by project)
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- Manual syncing from separate GitHub repos
